###  CodSoft Data Science Internship – Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**, where I worked on real-world machine learning tasks. These projects strengthened my data science skills in Python through hands-on model building, evaluation, and visualization.

####  Internship Tasks:

1.  **Titanic Survival Prediction**

   * Built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict passenger survival using demographic and travel features.
   * **Dataset Used**: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
   * Focused on feature engineering, data cleaning, and evaluation metrics.

2.  **Movie Rating Prediction**

   * Applied **Linear Regression** to estimate IMDb movie ratings using numeric features like votes and duration.
   * **Dataset Used**: IMDb Movies Metadata
   * Explored regression performance using RMSE and R².

3.  **Iris Flower Classification**

   * Developed a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to predict iris flower species.
   * **Dataset Used**: Iris Dataset (UCI ML Repository)
   * Emphasized clean data visualization and classification accuracy.

4.  **Sales Prediction**

   * Implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict product sales based on advertising budgets across TV, radio, and newspapers.
   * **Dataset Used**: Advertising Dataset
   * Focused on multivariate regression, feature importance, and performance tuning.

5.  **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

   * Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.
   * **Dataset Used**: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)
   * Used techniques like precision-recall analysis, SMOTE, and ROC-AUC scoring.

###  Tools & Technologies:

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: `pandas`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
* **Platform**: Google Colab
* **Skills Gained**: Supervised learning, model evaluation, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive analysis

This internship gave me practical exposure to building intelligent systems and solving business problems using data.
